# CUP-To-Contact   
A simple mission script that replaces old A2-era buildings from CUP with ones that have interiors from Contact.
It accounts for the offset between models as to prevent horrendous clipping and misplaced objects.

## What does it do?
It switches out old A2-era CUP buildings with new, enterable ones from the Contact/Livonia DLC, while accounting for the differences in offset between the models. 
This is done in order to prevent clipping and things like dumpsters, sign posts, benches, etc. from being inside the houses.
It requires [CUP Terrains - Core](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=583496184) and takes effect in postInit. 
If you wish to edit houses in the editor, you may use the "Hide Object" module on the area and houses you wish to edit/clear. 

## Installation
Installation is simple. Extract the .zip to your mission folder and merge the description.ext into your one. Ta-da, the script now takes effect on your mission. 

## Known Issues 
Unfortunately, something that cannot really be accounted for is that some buildings will have the terrain clipping into them. 
It is not at all game breaking and serves mostly as a visual annoyance, but it is still a shame that it is there.  

## Credits 
I would like to give big thanks to:
*Diwako*, for the scripting help and general advice and *Simkas*, for helping me to get started and wrapping my head around things
