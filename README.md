# CUP-To-Contact
 A simple mission script that replaces old A2-era buildings from CUP with ones that have interiors from Contact.  It accounts for the offset between models as to prevent horrendous clipping and misplaced objects.

## What does it do?
It switches out old A2-era CUP buildings with new, enterable ones from the Contact/Livonia DLC, while accounting for the differences in offset between the models. This is done in order to prevent clipping and things like dumpsters, sign posts, benches, etc. from being inside the houses. It requires CUP Terrains - Core.
It takes effect in postInit. If you wish to edit houses in the editor, you may use the "Hide Object" module on the house you wish to replace/clear. 

## Installation
Installation is simple. Extract the .zip to your mission folder and merge the description.ext into your one. Ta-da, the script now takes effect on your mission.
